# Atlantis Testing with Text File

This is a simple test to verify Atlantis webhook functionality.

## Test Details
- Date: 07/18/2025 14:28:21
- Purpose: Test pull request automation
- File Type: Simple text file (not Terraform)

## Expected Behavior
When this pull request is created, Atlantis should:
1. Detect the change
2. Comment on the pull request
3. Indicate no Terraform files found (which is expected)

This confirms the webhook integration is working correctly.
